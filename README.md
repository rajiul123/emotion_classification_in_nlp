**Emotion Classification In NLP**

This is a beginner level NLP project as I'm learning it.

Observations are as bellow:
* Text Preprocessing was helpful in this project as after doing text processing the precision, recall, f1-score and accuracy has increased significantly.
* Countvectorizer with trigrams has not produced expected result
* But unigram and bigrams has improved the precision, recall, f1-score and accuracy has increased significantly.
* Random Forest has performed well compared to Naive Bayes
* Random Forest with both Count Vectorizer and Tf-Idf Vectorizer has performed well.
